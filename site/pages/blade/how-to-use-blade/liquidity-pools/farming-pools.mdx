# Farming Pools

Blade's farming pools are multi-asset liquidity pools made up of Core Assets. They function like the main pools but have the added benefit of enabling LPs to earn reward tokens for staking their liquidity.

### How to Deposit into a Farming Pool:

1. From Blade's farming page, enter the token and amount you wish to deposit and connect your wallet.  
   _Note: The pool supports both individual asset and multi-asset deposits. If you are depositing $100k USD or more, a multi-asset deposit is recommended for better reward profits._
2. Allow Blade to use your tokens.
3. You will be shown your potential reward token earnings. Rewards will depend not only on the size of your deposit and the current size of the pool, but **also on how long you let your rewards grow**.
4. Confirm your deposit.
5. Once the transaction completes in your wallet, your liquidity will be added to the farming pool and will start accruing reward tokens. You will receive BladeLP tokens upon depositing. BladeLP tokens simply represent your fractional ownership of the underlying pool, they have no intrinsic value. BladeLP is used in the harvesting process, so hold onto them.

ðŸŒ¾ **Note:** Farming rewards continue to grow for the entire duration that your liquidity remains in the pool. You can withdraw at any time, however, there is an initial "waiting period" if you want to harvest your full rewards. Below is an example of how this works:

The duration of the "waiting period" is specified upon deposit _(often 30 days but may vary)_. If the current reward rate is 5 tokens per day (hypothetical), on day 30 you will have accrued 150 reward tokens, at which point you can harvest all 150 tokens (100% of your return). However, if you decide to withdraw on day 20, for example, you will only receive a portion of the 100 tokens you've accrued (\<100% of reward--exact amount depends on various factors) because you have not met the waiting period requirement yet. Once you hit the "waiting period" requirement, you will receive 100% of your accrued rewards (_on that deposit_) from that day onward--and **rewards continue to accrue even after the "waiting period" is reached.**

**This is intended to reward LPs who leave their liquidity in for longer durations and incentivize longer-term liquidity provision rather than quick reward schemes.**

### How to Harvest Rewards

1. Visit the **Rewards page** to view your harvest data and harvest your rewards. Harvest data shows how much of your rewards are currently available to claim and how much time is left until you reach your maximum claim amount.
2. Click "Harvest" to begin harvesting.
3. Enter the amount of reward tokens you want to harvest. This can be equal to or less than the amount you have available to harvest.
4. Allow Clipper to use your BladeLP tokens to harvest Sreward tokens.
5. Confirm your harvest.
6. Once the transaction completes in your wallet, your reward tokens are harvested to your wallet.
