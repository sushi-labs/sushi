# Liquidity Pools

Blade's pools are multi-asset liquidity pools composed of Blade Core Assets (_usually ETH, WBTC, USDC, USDT, DAI, and the native token of the given chain_). These assets are commodities that comprise 70% of all trade volume in DeFi.

Unlike most DEX liquidity pools, Blade LPs earn yield on a _pro rata_ portion of the entire pool, not just the asset(s) they deposit. Upon deposit, LPs receive LP tokens which represent their fractional ownership of the underlying pool. LP tokens have no value other than this representation.

There is one liquidity pool on each chain. The benefit of using one unified pool is to consolidate liquidity, rather than fragmenting it across multiple pools to achieve the same pairings. This increases capital efficiency, allowing for higher yields with lower fees.
