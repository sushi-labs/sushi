V3 enhances the decentralized exchange experience by introducing more flexibility and efficiency for liquidity providers and traders.

### Key Features:
- **Concentrated Liquidity:** Allows LPs to allocate capital to specific price ranges for improved efficiency.

- **Active Position Management:** LPs can dynamically manage their positions for optimized returns.
